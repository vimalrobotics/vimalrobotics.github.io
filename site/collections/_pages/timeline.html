      <p>
      Transitioned toward embedded system reliability and safety.
      Developed IoT-enabled control systems using ESP8266, incorporating
      electrical isolation and cloud-based voice control.
      </p>

      <h3>2020 — Human Interaction & Embedded Intelligence</h3>
      <p>
      Worked on embedded vision systems and human-centered automation.
      Designed a face-detection-based welcome system with text-to-speech
      interaction aimed at stress reduction in public and workplace environments.
      </p>

      <h3>2021 — Mechatronics & Bio-Inspired Design</h3>
      <p>
      Focused on mechanical intelligence and adaptive manipulation.
      Designed a bio-inspired adaptive vacuum gripper integrating compliant
      Fin Ray structures, suction mechanisms, and electrostatic braking for
      industrial pick-and-place tasks.
      </p>

      <h3>2022 — Robotics Systems & Competitive Engineering</h3>
      <p>
      Participated in large-scale robotics competitions, developing a crane
      hook tracking and positioning system using a flight controller,
      wireless ultrasonic sensing, and a custom ground station interface.
      Reached the final round of the Techgium competition.
      </p>

      <h3>2023 — Autonomous Robotics & Research</h3>
      <p>
