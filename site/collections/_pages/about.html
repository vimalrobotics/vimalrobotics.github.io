      <p>
      I am a Robotics Engineer with hands-on experience in the design, development,
      and deployment of autonomous robotic systems in real-world environments.
      My work spans the full robotics stack, with a strong focus on ROS&nbsp;2-based
      software development, embedded systems, and hardware–software integration.
      </p>

      <p>
      I specialize in building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), assistive robotic
      systems, and intelligent IoT-enabled devices. My engineering approach blends
      control theory, perception, embedded programming, and system-level design
      to create reliable and scalable robotic solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
      I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Robotics and Automation and a Diploma in
      Electronics and Robotics. During my academic and professional journey,
      I have worked on research-driven projects including an IEEE-published
      assistive robotic platform, vision-based robotic manipulation systems,
      and human-centric monitoring devices.
      </p>

      <p>
      Currently, my interests lie in autonomous navigation, sensor fusion,
      embedded AI, and assistive robotics. I am particularly motivated by
      projects that bridge theoretical robotics research with practical,
      deployable systems that have a direct human impact.
