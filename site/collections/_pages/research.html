      <h3>Published Research</h3>
      <p>
      <strong>Stormbreaker: An Assistive Autonomous Towing Robot</strong><br>
      IEEE Conference Publication, 2023
      </p>
      <p>
      This research presents the design and implementation of an assistive
      autonomous robotic system capable of towing a wheelchair in real-world
      environments. The system integrates ROS-based navigation, sensor fusion,
      and safety-aware control strategies to enable reliable autonomous motion
      alongside human users.
