      <p>
      I design and develop autonomous mobile robots, assistive robotic systems,
      and intelligent embedded platforms with a strong emphasis on robustness,
      safety, and deployment-readiness.
      </p>
      <p>
      My background combines academic research, industry experience, and
      hands-on engineering, including an IEEE-published assistive robot,
      vision-guided manipulators, and human-centric IoT monitoring systems.
