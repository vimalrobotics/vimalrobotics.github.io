## Overview
This project involved the design of a low-cost servo-driven robot arm capable of recording and replaying joint motions.
The mechanical structure was fabricated using recycled laptop plastic parts.

## Technical Focus
- ESP8266-based control
- Servo actuation and synchronization
- Power management under dynamic load

## Key Challenges
- Servo jitter under load
- Power supply instability
- Mechanical stress on joints

## Engineering Solutions
- Implemented pulley-based load reduction
- Improved power distribution
- Optimized servo update timing

## Key Learnings
- Electrical power quality directly affects mechanical stability
- Mechanical design choices simplify control complexity
